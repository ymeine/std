## Split an array into chunks of equal size

Divides the given array into a list of arrays having the given desired length.

The last one might not have a length of the given chunk size, depending on the rest of the division.

This function is __curried__.

### Names

* `split`
* `divide`

### Arguments

1. `chunkSize`
	* __in__, __required__, must be strictly positive
	* type: `Number`
	* The desired length of the resulting arrays
1. `array`
	* __in__, __required__
	* type: `Any ⊢ Array`
	* The array to process

### Returns

* type: `Array ∋ Array`
* The list of arrays

### Description

The given chunk size must be strictly positive, and if it exceeds the size of the given array it is considered to be equal to it.

The parts will all have the given size, except maybe the last one, which will take the remaining items, thus having a size lower or equal than the chunk size.

### Example

```livescript
split 2 [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10] # => [[0 1] [2 3] [4 5] [6 7] [8 9] [10] ]
```

### Backlog

Provide an option to let the user decide which part (array) is going to receive the remaining items - or in other words which part would be likely to get a different size: the last one (as it is currently implemented), or the first one.





## Remove an element at a given index

Removes from the given array the item located at the specified index.

The process is __inplace__.

### Names

* `removeAt`
* `removeat`
* `remAt`
* `remat`
* `rmat`
* `deleteAt`
* `deleteat`
* `delAt`
* `delat`

### Arguments

1. `array`
	* __out__, __required__
	* type: `Array`
	* The array to process.
1. `index`
	* __in__, __required__
	* type: `Number`
	* The index of the element to remove.
}

### Returns

Returns the given array for chaining.





## Remove a given element

Removes the given item from the given array.

### Names

* `remove`
* `removeItem`
* `removeitem`
* `rem`
* `rm`
* `delete`
* `del`

### Arguments

1. `array`
	* __out__, __required__
	* type: `Array`
	* The array to process.
1. `index`
	* __in__, __required__
	* type: `Any`
	* The element to remove.
}

### Returns

Returns the given array for chaining.

### Description

This method relies on the native `Array.prototype.indexOf` method to find the element in the array.

It then calls the method `removeAt`, so please refer to it for more information.





## Build (or ensure) an array from a set of elements

Builds an array - if not already done - from the given input.

### Names

* `factory`

### Arguments

You can give any number of arguments of any type. See description for more information.

The function will test the length of the `arguments` object to perform the proper action, keep this is mind. For instance, calling a function without argument and calling the same function with one void argument is not the same in this case.

### Returns

* type: `Array`
* An array of any size, of any element, whatever you gave as argument. See description for more information.

### Description

If you don't give any argument, an empty array is returned.

If you give more than one argument, we consider these are the items of the array to build, no matter the actual values of those elements (including void values and arrays).

If you give one argument only, the process is a bit different:

* if the given element is not defined, it's like if you didn't provide any: an empty array is returned
* if the element is already an array: it is returned as is (useful for consistency in your code)
* if the element is not an array, it is _wrapped_ into a new one: an array containing this element only





## Sort an array of objects based on a property of this object

### Names

* `sortBy`
* `sortby`
* `sort`

### Arguments

1. `array`
	* __in__, __required__
	* type: `Array ∋ (Any ⊢ Object)`
	* The array to sort.
1. `property`
	* __in__, __required__
	* type: `Any ⊢ String`
	* The name of the property to use for sorting
1. `undefinedAtBeginning`
	* __in__, __optional__: defaults to `true`
	* type: `Any ⊢ Boolean`
	* Tells whether to put objects without the given property at the beginning (when truthy) of the resulting sorted array, or at its end (when falsy).

### Returns

* type: `Array`
* The sorted array.





## Transform an array

Transforms elements of a given array with the given callback.

The transformation can be made inplace.

### Names

* `transform`
* `map`

### Arguments

1. `cb`
	* __in__, __required__
	* type: `Function: [Any] → Any`
	* The callback receiving the current item and returning it transformed.
1. `array`
	* __in__ or __in/out__, __required__
	* type: `Any ⊢ Array`
	* The array to transform
1. inplace
	* __in__, __optional__: defaults to `false`
	* type: `Any ⊢ Boolean`
	* Tells whether to do the operation inplace (if truthy) or not (if falsy).

### Returns

If the operation is inplace, the given array, for chaining (and consistency with the case below).

Otherwise:

* type: `Array`
* A new array containing the transformed items
