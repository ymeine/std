## Split an array into chunks of equal size

This function extracts parts of given size from the given array.

This function is __curried__.

### Names

* `split`
* `divide`

### Arguments

1. `chunkSize`
	* __in__, __required__, must be strictly positive
	* type: `Number`
	* The wanted size of the resulting parts
1. `array`
	* __in__, __required__
	* type: `Array`
	* The array to split

### Returns

* type: `Array ∋ Array`
* The parts resulting from the split.

### Description

The given chunk size must be strictly positive, and if it exceeds the size of the given array it is set to this size.

The parts will all have the given size, except maybe the last one, which will take the remaining items, thus having a size lower or equal than the chunk size.

### Example

```livescript
split 2 [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10] # => [[0 1] [2 3] [4 5] [6 7] [8 9] [10] ]
```



## Remove an element at a given index

Removes from the given array the item located at the specified index.

### Names

* `removeAt`
* `removeat`
* `remAt`
* `remat`
* `rmat`
* `deleteAt`
* `deleteat`
* `delAt`
* `delat`

### Arguments

1. `array`
	* __out__, __required__
	* type: `Array`
	* The array to process.
1. `index`
	* __in__, __required__
	* type: `Number`
	* The index of the element to remove. For specifications about it, please refer to the native `Array.prototype.slice` method it uses behind.
}

### Returns

Returns the given array for chaining.





## Remove a given element

Removes the given item from the given array.

### Names

* `remove`
* `removeItem`
* `removeitem`
* `rem`
* `rm`
* `delete`
* `del`

### Arguments

1. `array`
	* __out__, __required__
	* type: `Array`
	* The array to process.
1. `index`
	* __in__, __required__
	* type: `Any`
	* The element to remove.
}

### Returns

Returns the given array for chaining.



## Build (or ensure) an array from a set of elements

A factory for arrays.

### Names

* `factory`

### Arguments

You can give any number of arguments of any type. See description for more information.

The function will test the length of the `arguments` object to perform the proper action, so keep this is mind. For instance, calling a function without argument and calling the same function with one void argument is not the same in this case. Even if when we want to access this argument we get a void value in both cases.

### Returns

* type: `Array`
* An array of any size, of any element, whatever you gave as argument. See description for more information.

### Description

If you don't give any argument, an empty array will be returned.

If you give more than one argument, we consider these are the items of the array to build, no matter is the actual values of those elements (including void values and arrays).

If you give one argument only, the process is a bit different:

* if the given element is not defined, it's like if you didn't provide any: an empty array is returned
* if the element is already an array: we return it as is (you would use it just for consistency in your code)
* if the element is not array, it is _wrapped_ into a new one: an array containing this element only.




## Sort an array of objects based on a property of this object

### Names

* `sortBy`
* `sortby`
* `sort`

### Arguments

1. `array`
	* __in__, __required__
	* type: `Array ∋ (Any ⊢ Object)`
	* The array to sort.
1. `property`
	* __in__, __required__
	* type: `Any ⊢ String`
	* The name of the property to use for sorting
1. `undefinedAtBeginning`
	* __in__, __optional__: defaults to `true`
	* type: `Any ⊢ Boolean`
	* Tells whether to put objects without the given property at the beginning (when truthy) of the resulting sorted array, or at its end (when falsy).

### Returns

* type: `Array`
* The sorted array.





## Transform an array

Transforms elements of a given array with the given callback.

The transformation can be made inplace.

### Names

* `transform`
* `map`

### Arguments

1. `cb`
	* __in__, __required__
	* type: `Function: [Any] → Any`
	* The callback receiving the current item and returning it transformed.
1. `array`
	* __in__ or __in/out__, __required__
	* type: `Array`
	* The array to transform
1. inplace
	* __in__, __optional__: defaults to `false`
	* type: `Any ⊢ Boolean`
	* Tells whether to do the operation inplace (if truthy) or not (if falsy). _Inplace_ means that the given array is directly altered.

### Returns

If the operation is inplace, the given array, for chaining (and consistency with the case below).

Otherwise:

* type: `Array`
* A new array containing the transformed items
