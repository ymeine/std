# Backlog

* Add the types 'Undefined' and `Null`
* Add the fix for `null` values
* Be able to have a funciton checking only native types, but accepting as input a _fuzzy_ string. For instance: `type.is 'str' str` would return `true`. in another context this could collide with custom types, but onyl if we consider the set of native types.
