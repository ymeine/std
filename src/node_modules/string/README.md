## Capitalize the first letter of a string

Returns a new string with the first letter transformed to upper case (the rest is left completely untouched).

### Status

Stable

### Names

* `capitalize`

### Arguments

1. `input`
	* __in__, __required__
	* type: `String`
	* The string to capitalize

### Returns

* type: `String`
* The capitalized string.

### Description

The first letter is capitalized using the native `String.prototype.toUpperCase` method.




## Split a string into parts using a completely custom predicate

Splits a string into several strings following the rules of your custom predicate.

### Names

* `split`

### Arguments

1. `input`
	* __in__, __required__
	* Please refer to `array.split` for more information
1. `cb`
	* __in__, __required__
	* Please refer to `array.split` for more information

### Returns

* type: `Array ∋ String`
* The resulting parts.

### Description

Please refer to the function `split` of the module `array`.

This function here is just converting all the resulting parts to strings before returning them, so that you get an array of strings instead of an array of arrays.




## Extract parts of a camel cased string

Splits the given string into parts delimited by its capital letters.

### Status

Checked.

### Names

* `getCamelCaseParts`
* `camelCaseParts`
* `camelcaseparts`
* `camelCase`
* `camelcase`

### Arguments

1. `input`
	* __in__, __required__
	* type: `String`
	* The camel cased string

### Returns

* type: `Array ∋ String`
* The parts of the string.

### Description

In short: this function doesn't care about if the string follows a proper camel case convention and simply splits it at any capital letter.

In fact the camel case is a convention in which you write a sequence of words without space or any special characters, and you delimit the words by lowering their case and putting only their first letter to upper case.

Example: `This set of words` gives `thisSetOfWords` in _lowerCaseCamel_ and `ThisSetOfWords` in _UpperCaseCamel_. The difference between the two is just the choice made for the first word, for which the first letter is _free_.

However, this function has been made more generic. Since it doesn't have to validate that the input is an actual camel cased string - that is without space or any other special characters - it just extracts parts delimited by capital letters.

### Issues

Maybe taking spaces and other special characaters into account would be a good thing.

Example:

```livescript
getCamelCaseParts 'ThisIsA phraseSplitInSeveral camelCasedStrings.'
```

I would expect a result like this:

```livescript
[
	'This'
	'Is'
	'A'
	'phrase'
	'Split'
	'In'
	'Several'
	'camel'
	'Cased'
	'Strings'
]
```

__But maybe we should focus on real camel cased strings, and leave the handling of full sentences for something more complex.__





## Escape characters in a string

Escapes the given characters in the given string, with the given or default escaping character. Escaping means prepending special characters to another one, usually to avoid the latter being interpreted as a character with a special meaning.

### Names

* `escape`
* `esc`

### Arguments

1. `input`
	* __in__, __required__
	* type: `String`
	* The string containing the characters to escape
1. `chars`
	* __in__, __required__
	* type: `String | Array ∋ (Any ⊢ String)`
	* The list of chars to escape
1. `escapeChar`
	* __in__, __optional__: defaults to `\`
	* type: `Any ⊢ String`
	* The character/string to put before the given characters, to escape them

### Returns

* type: `String`
* The new string with escaped characters.

### Description

Looping over the collection containing the chars to escape is done with a classical `for` loop with an index, so any compatible collection can be provided.




## Surround a string with another one

Inserts a given pattern completely before and completely after the given string.

### Names

* `surround`

### Arguments

1. `string`
	* __in__, __required__
	* type: `Any ⊢ String`
	* The pattern to insert into the given input
1. `input`
	* __in__, __required__
	* type: `Any ⊢ String`
	* The string to surround

### Returns

* type: `String`
* The surrounded string.

### Description

For more advanced features, please see the `wrap` function.

### Examples

```livescript
string.surround '===' 'Introduction' # => '===Introduction==='
```




## Reverse a string

Returns a new string with the characters of the give one in reverse order.

### Names

* `reverse`
* `invert`

### Arguments

1. `input`
	* __in__, __required__
	* type: `String`
	* The string to reverse

### Returns

* type: `String`
* The string reversed.

### Description





## Wrap a string with a pattern

Almost like `surround`, but reverses the given pattern when putting it at the end.

### Names

* `wrap`

### Arguments

1. ``
	* __in__
	* type: ``
	*

### Returns

* type: ``
*

### Description





## Replace portions of a string

Replaces a given portion of the string, with another given string. __Note__ that the given string will be completely written no matter the given portion, possibly resulting in strings of different sizes.

### Names

* `replace`
* `overwrite`
* `rewrite`

### Arguments

1. `string`
	* __in__, __required__
	* type: `String`
	* The string to alter
1. `content`
	* __in__, __required__
	* type: `String`
	* The content used to overwrite part of the given string
1. `start`
	* _in_, __optional__: defaults to `0`, that is the beginning of the string
	* type: `Any ⊢ Number`
	* __0-based__; The index of the string in which to begin overwriting
1. `start`
	* _in_, __optional__: defaults to `start` plus the length of the given content
	* type: `Any`
	* __0-based__; The index of the string in which to stop overwriting

### Returns

* type: ``
*

### Description





## Insert a string into another


### Names

* `insert`
* `put`

### Arguments

1. `string`
	* __in__, __required__
	* type: `String`
	* The string into which content will be inserted
1. `content`
	* __in__, __required__
	* type: `String`
	* The content to insert into the string
1. `offset`
	* _in_, __optional__: defaults to `0`, that is the beginning of (before) the string
	* type: ``

### Returns

* type: `String`
* The new string with the second one inserted into the first one at the specified offset.

### Description

Relies on `replace`.



# Backlog

* Enhance wrap, but instead of repeaing the string in the suffix, add the reversed form of it. However, this could be even better with semantics. Examples:
	* "=== str ===": this way the string is wrapped by spaces in addition to equal sign
	* ">>> str <<<": this implies knowing the 'inverse' of a character (brackets too)

## Tests

* add `escape`
* add `surround`
