# Backlog

* Add a function similar to surround, but instead of repeaing the string in the suffix, add the reversed form of it. However, this could be even better with semantics. Examples:
	* "=== str ===": this way the string is wrapped by spaces in addition to equal sign
	* ">>> str <<<": this implies knowing the 'inverse' of a character (brackets too)

## Tests

* add `escape`
* add `surround`
