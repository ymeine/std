## Compute the sum of a set of numbers

Sums the given numbers.

### Names

* `sum`

### Arguments

You can pass any number of argument.

Arguments can be of these types:

* `Number`
* `Array ∋ Number`
* `Array ∋ (Number | Array ∋ Number)` and so on (any nested array of numbers or number itself is supported)

### Description

The sum is defined as the result of the addition of all the numbers together.





## Compute the mean value of a set of numbers

Calculates the mean value of the given numbers.

### Names

* `mean`
* `average`

### Arguments

__They follow the same rules as the `sum` function.__ Please refer to its documentation

### Returns

* type: `Number`
* The mean value

### Description

The mean value of a set of numbers is defined as the division of their sum by the amount of numbers.





## Test if a number is odd

Tells if the given value is an odd number or not.

### Names

* `isOdd`
* `isodd`
* `odd`

### Arguments

1. `value`
	* __in__, __required__
	* type: `Any ⊢ Number`
	* The value to check

### Returns

* type: `Boolean | Number`
* `true` if the value is an odd number, `false` if not and `NaN` if the value cannot be converted to a number.

### Description

It internally uses the modulo (`%`) operator.

An odd number is defined as a number for which the rest of its division by 2 is 1. __This rule is relevant only for integers.__




## Test if a number is even

Tells if the given value is an even number or not.

__Please refer to `isOdd`, since this function is purely its negation.__


### Names

* `isEven`
* `iseven`
* `even`
