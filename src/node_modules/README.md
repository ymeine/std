# Backlog

## Various

* consider using [`prelude-ls`](http://preludels.com) instead of [`lodash`](http://lodash.com), especially for
	* the `sortBy` implementation in [`array`](./array) with the use of `reject` and `select`
	* maths library
* as for IO, consider being able to configure a module, or single functions. For instance, asking for a strict mode with checkings and exceptions, or a smooth mode, with default return values (even if it can sometimes be ambiguous), optimized form, etc.
* create a module for validation, the one I use to throw errors from constructor when I check both existence anbd type(s)

# Ideas of modules
